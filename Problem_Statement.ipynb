    "The book, *Regression Models, Methods and Applications* by Fahrmeir, L., Kneib, Th., Lang, S., Marx, B. has a great exploration of all parametic and non-parametric tools within the Regression Framework.  Each method that the authors present to their readers are always paired with a real-world example.  One that I have always enjoyed was the Munich Rent dataset.  I have never been to Munich, but for some reason felt more interested in the discussion of say **General Likelihood Mixed Models** when this dataset was referenced.  This books was also the cornerstone of a Regression class I took in the past in schhol and would like to revisit some of its methods to help rekindle some of my dormant statistics knowledge.  \n",

    "I will need to collect two datasets.  One dataset will be rental data on Philadelphia, Munich and Toronto.  The second dataset will consist of foursquare data for the three cities. I will attempt to merge the datasets together in a sensible way and see what foursquare data has strong correlation with higher rents in respecive neighborhoods.  I will then attempt to create several models, yet to be determined, that predict rent of the nieghborhood based on foursquare data.  For example, the presence of dog parks in the neighborhood produces an in\n",
